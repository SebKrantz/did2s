Description: This package creates the funciton `did2s` which allows you to estimate TWFE diff-in-diff/event-study models. To avoid the problems caused by OLS estimation of the TWFE model, this function first estimates the fixed effects and covariates using untreated observations and then in a second stage, estimates the treatment effects.
